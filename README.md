# patlikuran

solver for a traditional card game (I am not sure about its origin)

four cards are dealt randomly with values between 1 to 13.
players are supposed to perform basic arithmetic operations 
(addition, substraction, multiplication, division) between
the numbers to make the grand total of 24

(hence it is patlikur, 24 in Javanese)
